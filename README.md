# Code Refactoring

## description: 

A marketing agency wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards
so that their own site is optimized for search engines

Given a webpage meets accessibility standards
If I view the source code, I find semantic HTML elements
If I view the structure of the HTML elements, I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
If I view the icon and image elements, I find accessible alt attributes
If I view the heading attributes, they fall in sequential order
If I view the title element,I find a concise, descriptive title

## Technologies: 

HTML, CSS
